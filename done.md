# a list of todos that are already done

## 1. BIG TODO: togglable light bulb (in preparation of first level)(requires interactions with objects, lights, shadows)

1. redo the file structure?
2. bounding_box_from_model(ModelHandle model) or hardcode bounding boxes(why not both?)
   - could specify in the file format if the bounding box is hardcoded or if i want to load it from the model itself
   - because i might want invisible entities, so then i would need to hardcode it
3. read entities and keymap from files(custom file format)
4. change texture(?) of light bulb between lit and unlit when interacting
